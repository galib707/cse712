This chapter did build ideas sequentially as all chapters did because chapter has paragraphs, which are always sequential, but I found these paragraphs as supporting ideas, that played as supporting actors to clarify the main idea of "ASR". Therefore, I have drawn the concept map in a flower-like structure, where core remained in the center, surrounded by the petals. Also wrote side-notes to put extra information. Side-notes could be extended as petals, but I found that then the number of petals increases dramatically. Size and color of petals do not signify any meaning, but levels do. (I have used LaTeX and Tikz for this report)
