I have tried to cover almost every chapter from the book of "Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain by Andreas M. Antonopoulos ". This book contains insightful literature on Bitcoin, and some good code example, enough to start an intro to Bitcoin. It did build ideas sequentially as all books did because books have chapters, which are always sequential, but I found these chapters as supporting ideas, that played as supporting actors to clarify the main idea of "Bitcoin". Therefore, I have drawn the concept map in a flower-like structure, where core remained in the center, surrounded by the petals. Also wrote side-notes to put extra information. Side-notes could be extended as petals, but I found that then the number of petals increases dramatically. Size and color of petals do not signify any meaning, but levels do. (I have used LaTeX and Tikz for this report)
